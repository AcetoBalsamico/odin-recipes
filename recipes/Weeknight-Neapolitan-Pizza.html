    <h2>Weeknight Neapolitan-Style Pizza</h2>
<p>
    This pizza has the hallmark crispy/chewy crust you’d find at a classic Italian pizzeria. And since it takes just under 3 hours from start to finish, with a little planning it can be dinner on a busy weeknight. The recipe yields two 10" to 12" pizzas.

    <h2>Ingredients for Weeknight Neapolitan Pizza</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons instant yeast or active dry yeast</li>
        <li>7/8 to 1 cup (198g to 227g) lukewarm water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (25g) olive oil</li>
        <li>3 cups (360g) Pizza Flour</li>
        <li>1 1/4 teaspoons (8g) salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Make a Weeknight Neapolitan Style Pizza</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. Combine all of the dough ingredients and mix together — by hand, mixer, or bread machine set on the dough cycle — until you’ve made a soft, smooth dough. If you’re kneading in a stand mixer, it should take 4 to 5 minutes at second speed, and the dough should barely clean the sides of the bowl. If it sticks a bit at the bottom, that’s fine.</li>

        <li>Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover, and allow it to rise until it’s very puffy, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</li>

        <li>Once the dough has risen, divide it in half. Shape each half into a ball, and place each into a lightly greased bowl. Cover and let rise for 45 minutes to an hour while your oven preheats.</li>

        <li>Place a rack in the center of the oven with a baking stone and preheat the oven to 500°F.</li>

        <li>Transfer one ball of dough to a well-floured or semolina-dusted work surface and sprinkle the top with flour or semolina. Use your fingertips to gently depress the interior of the round, leaving a slightly thicker edge on the outer rim about 1/2" wide. Stretch the dough into a 10" to 12" circle.</li>

        <li>Top the crust with sauce and cheese as desired, and bake on the preheated stone for 10 to 12 minutes, until the crust is golden and the toppings are bubbly.</li>

        <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and add any last-minute toppings before cutting and serving.</li>

        <li>Store leftover pizza in the refrigerator for a day or so; freeze for longer storage. </li>        
    </ol>
